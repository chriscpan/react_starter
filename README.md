# React App Starter

Since implementing all the boilerplate code for React apps can get a bit
tedious, so here is all the minimum requirements for a React app built with a
Redux pattern.

To start, simply do `npm-install` and `npm run start`, which will run all the
webpack configurations on the webpack-dev-server.

Does not include Providers and Connectors.
